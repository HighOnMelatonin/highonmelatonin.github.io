## Week 1: Review of Functions
### Set and Interval notation
- A set: an unordered collection of objects, defined between "{}"
- Union: all elements in both sets
- Intersection: elements common to both sets

*If not specified, assume x is a real number

### Functions
- Domain: all possible inputs (x)
- Range: all possible outputs (y)
A graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph <strong>at most once</strong>

Square root refers to the principal square root (assume positive root), if unspecified

### Combining Functions
- Composite functions: f(g(x))

### Difference Quotient
- Secant line: a line that passes through 2 points on a curve

### Symmetries of graphs
- Even function: f(-x) == f(x) (Symmetric about the Y-axis)
- Odd function: f(-x) == -f(x) (Symmetric about the origin)

If the graph is symmetric about the x-axis, there is more than one output value for an x-value, therefore its not a function :)
