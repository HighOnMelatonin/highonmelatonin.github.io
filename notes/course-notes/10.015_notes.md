## Week 1: Vector in Physics and Engineering
A scalar quantity is completely specified by a magnitude with an appropriate unit and has no direction. Examples of scalar quantities: temperature, air pressure, mass. However, many physical quantities possess both magnitudes and directions, which is where <strong>vectors</strong> come into play. 
Vector quantities are denoted with an arrow above the symbol, taking the modulus of the vector, gives the magnitude. While dividing the vector by the magnitude gives the direction of the vector. 
"A hat" refers to a unit vector of magnitude 1, paraller to vector A. 
> Vector A = Magnitude A * Direction A

### Vector Algebra
Angle between vectors are always measured at the tails

To add 2 vectors: <b><i>A</i></b> + <b><i>B</i></b> = <b><i>C</i></b>
1. Translate the 2 vectors until their tails coincide, keeping the magnitudes and directions unchanged
2. Construct a parallelogram and the diagonal vector C from the origin to the tail of both vectors is the sum of the vectors

To subtract a vector: <b><i>C</i></b> - <b><i>A</i></b> = <b><i>B</i></b>
1. -<b><i>A</i></b> = Opposite direction of <b><i>A</i></b>

#### Case Problem 0: Vector Algebra <br>
$$\vert\overrightarrow{C}\vert = \sqrt{\vert{A}\vert^2 + \vert{B}\vert^2 + 2\vert{A}\vert\vert{B}\vert\cos{\varTheta}}$$
$$\vert\overrightarrow{C}\vert =\sqrt{\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2\cos{\varTheta}}$$
$$10^2 = 5\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2\cos{\varTheta}$$
$$\vert{A}\vert = 3.56$$
$$\vert{A}\vert = 7.12$$

Angle between the two vectors:
$$\sin{30} = 2\sin{\alpha}$$
$$0.5 = 2\sin{\alpha}$$
$$\alpha = 14.477^\circ$$

### Polar Coordinate System
Polar coordinate system revolves around a pole (hence the name). 
A position <b>P</b> is defined by distance <i>r</i> from the origin, at angle $\varTheta$, <b>P</b> = (r, $\varTheta$). 
Angle $\varTheta$ is measured with respoect to x-axis (conventionally anti-clockwise).
Unit vectors $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{\varTheta}$ are associated with coordinates (r $\varTheta$) where $\hat{r}$ points radially away from the origin, while $\hat{\varTheta}$ is tangential to the circular circumference (circle of radius r).
- $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{\varTheta}$ is a function of angle $\varTheta$, independent of position
- Take the absolute direction (not rotational trajectory)


| Cartesian Coordinate | Polar Coordinate |
|---|---|
|$(x, y)$ | (r,$\varTheta$) |
|---|---|
| $\overrightharpoon{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j}$ | $\overrightharpoon{r} = r\hat{r}$

The unit vectors are
$$\hat{r} = \cos{\varTheta\hat{i}} + \sin{\varTheta\hat{j}}$$
$$\hat{\varTheta} = -\sin{\varTheta\hat{i}} + \cos{\varTheta\hat{j}}$$
