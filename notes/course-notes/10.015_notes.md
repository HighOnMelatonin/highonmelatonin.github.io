## Week 1: Vector in Physics and Engineering
A scalar quantity is completely specified by a magnitude with an appropriate unit and has no direction. Examples of scalar quantities: temperature, air pressure, mass. However, many physical quantities possess both magnitudes and directions, which is where <strong>vectors</strong> come into play. 
Vector quantities are denoted with an arrow above the symbol, taking the modulus of the vector, gives the magnitude. While dividing the vector by the magnitude gives the direction of the vector. 
"A hat" refers to a unit vector of magnitude 1, paraller to vector A. 
> Vector A = Magnitude A * Direction A

### Vector Algebra
Angle between vectors are always measured at the tails

To add 2 vectors: <b><i>A</i></b> + <b><i>B</i></b> = <b><i>C</i></b>
1. Translate the 2 vectors until their tails coincide, keeping the magnitudes and directions unchanged
2. Construct a parallelogram and the diagonal vector C from the origin to the tail of both vectors is the sum of the vectors

To subtract a vector: <b><i>C</i></b> - <b><i>A</i></b> = <b><i>B</i></b>
1. -<b><i>A</i></b> = Opposite direction of <b><i>A</i></b>

#### Case Problem 0: Vector Algebra <br>
$$\vert\overrightarrow{C}\vert = \sqrt{\vert{A}\vert^2 + \vert{B}\vert^2 + 2\vert{A}\vert\vert{B}\vert\cos{\varTheta}}$$

$$\vert\overrightarrow{C}\vert =\sqrt{\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2\cos{\varTheta}}$$

$$10^2 = 5\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2 + 4\vert{A}\vert^2\cos{\varTheta}$$

$$\vert{A}\vert = 3.56$$

$$\vert{A}\vert = 7.12$$

Angle between the two vectors:

$$\sin{30} = 2\sin{\alpha}$$

$$0.5 = 2\sin{\alpha}$$

$$\alpha = 14.477^\circ$$

### Polar Coordinate System
Polar coordinate system revolves around a pole (hence the name). 
A position <b>P</b> is defined by distance <i>r</i> from the origin, at angle $\varTheta$, <b>P</b> = (r, $\varTheta$). 
Angle $\varTheta$ is measured with respoect to x-axis (conventionally anti-clockwise).
Unit vectors $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{\varTheta}$ are associated with coordinates (r $\varTheta$) where $\hat{r}$ points radially away from the origin, while $\hat{\varTheta}$ is tangential to the circular circumference (circle of radius r).
- $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{\varTheta}$ is a function of angle $\varTheta$, independent of position
- Take the absolute direction (not rotational trajectory)


| Cartesian Coordinate | Polar Coordinate |
|---|---|
|$(x, y)$ | (r,$\varTheta$) |
|---|---|
| $\overrightharpoon{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j}$ | $\overrightharpoon{r} = r\hat{r}$

The unit vectors are
$$\hat{r} = \cos{\varTheta\hat{i}} + \sin{\varTheta\hat{j}}$$
$$\hat{\varTheta} = -\sin{\varTheta\hat{i}} + \cos{\varTheta\hat{j}}$$

## Week 3-1: Concept of Forces and Newton's 3 Laws of Motion
### Newton's Laws
#### Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)
All objects with mass continues to move at a constant velocity unless there is a net physical force acting on the object. This law is only valid from an inertial frame of reference.

#### Newton's Second Law (Describing a force)
The net resultant force acting on a body is proportional to the acceleration. The constant of proportionality is the mass of the object
$$F = ma$$
$$F = m(\frac{dv}{dt})$$

#### Newton's Third Law
Physical force arises from the interaction of <strong>2 bodies</strong>. Whenever 2 bodies interact, forces of interaction must arise in pairs of action and reaction, which are equal in magnitudes but opposite in directions.
Also referred to as an action-reaction pair
$$F_{12} = -F_{21}$$
Action-reaction pairs must act on two different bodies in the same system.

### Forces
#### Gravitational Force
$$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
$$G = 6.67\times{10^{-11}}Nm^2/kg^2$$
G: Universal Gravitational constant

#### Contact Force
- Normal Force
  - Perpendicular to the surface
- Friction
   1. Static
      - When there is no motion between surfaces
      - $f_{s,max} = \mu_sN$
      - Below the maximum value, it is always equal and opposite to the direciton of the applied force
   2. Kinetic
      - When there is relative motion between surfaces
      - $f_{k} = \mu_kN$
      - Always constant

#### Spring Force
Force exerted by spring that tends to restore to the equilibrium position. It follows Hooke's law, $F = -k\Delta{l}$, where k is the spring constant
and $\Delta{l}$ is the displacement from equilibrium

#### Tension Force
Pulling force transmitted along the length of the string/cord

### Free Body Diagrams
A diagram showing just the chosen body only, free from its environment and any other objects interacting with it. 
Velocity and acceleration vectors should not appear on the body, only physical forces are allowed on the body.

### Case Problem 1


### Case Problem 2
$$F_{male}: 2T + N - m_1g = m_1a$$

$$F_{platform}: 2T - N - m_2g = m_2a$$

$$(m_1 + m_2)a = 4T - g(m_1 + m_2)$$

$$a = \frac{4T - g(m_1 + m_2)}{m_1 + m_2}$$

## Week 3-2: Friction Forces and Ideal Pulley Systems
### Case Problem 1
![Case Problem 1 diagram](week3-2_case_1.png)
Horizontal forces on 1 (parallel to the incline):<br>
Maximum static friction: $f = gm_1\mu_s\cos{\phi}$ <br>
Weight component parallel to incline: $w_x = m_1g\sin{\phi}$

At the moment before slipping, acceleration = 0,
$$T = f + w_x$$
$$m_2g = gm_1\mu_s\cos{\phi} + m_1g\sin{\phi}$$
$$m_2 = m_1(\mu_s\cos{\phi} + sin{\phi})$$

### Case Problem 2
![Case Problem 2 diagram](week3-2_case_2.png)


### Case Problem 3
![Case Problem 3 diagram](week3-2_case_3.png)
<sub>*Treat the pulleys and block as 1 unit (ie. ignore the tension between the pulley and their respective block)
Resultant Force on $m_1$:<br>
$F - 2T = m_1a_1$<br>

Resultant Force on $m_2$:<br>
$3T = m_2a_2$<br>

Geometrical Constraint: Inextensible string<br>
$3\Delta{x_2} = 2 \Delta{x_1}$, where $\Delta{x_1}$ refers to change in length of each string connected to block 1 and $\Delta{x_2}$ refers to change in length of each string connected to block 2.<br>
By taking the derivatives with respect to time,
$$3\Delta{x_2} = 2\Delta{x_1}$$
$$3V_2 = 2V_1$$
$$3a_2 = 2a_1$$

## Week 3 -2: Circular Motion
Position Vector : $\overrightarrow{r} = R\hat{r}, R$ is independent<br>
Velocity Vector: $\overrightarrow{v}=\frac{d\overrightarrow{r}}{dt} = 
\frac{d}{dt}(R\hat{r}) = R\frac{d}{dt}\hat{r} = R\frac{d\theta}{dt}\hat{\theta}$
- direction of velocity is $\hat{\theta}$
- define angular speed $\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$
- angular speed: $rads^{-1}$ or $rad/s$

$$\overrightarrow{V} = R\omega\hat{\theta}$$

Acceleration: 
$$\overrightarrow{a} = \frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(R\frac{d\theta}{dt}\hat{\theta})
= R\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\hat{\theta})$$

<br>

$$\overrightarrow{a} = R(\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2})\hat{\theta} + 
R(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\frac{d\theta^2}{dt})$$

<br>

$$\overrightarrow{a} = R(\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2})\hat{\theta} + R(\frac{d\theta}{dt})^2(-\hat{r})$$

Tangential acceleration, $\overrightarrow{a_\theta}$
- Direction of $\overrightarrow{a_\theta}$ is $\hat{\theta}$
- Increases/decreases the speed
- Rate of change of the mangitude of the velocity

Centripetal acceleration, $\overrightarrow{a_r}$
- Directed towards the center of the circular motion
- Causes constant change in direction of velocity
- $\overrightarrow{a_r} = -v\omega\hat{r} = -\frac{v^2}{R}\hat{r} = -\omega^2R\hat{r}$
  
  <sub>$R$ is the radius of rotation</sub><br>

### Case Problem 1
$${V_f}^2 = {V_i}^2 + 2as$$

$$0 = {V_i}^2 - 2gh$$

$$V_i = \sqrt{2gh}$$

$$\sqrt{2gh} = R\omega_i$$

$$w_i = \frac{\sqrt{2gh}}{R}$$


### Case Problem 2
Part a:
$$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = A - 3Bt^2$$

Part b:
$$\overrightarrow{v} = R\omega\hat{\theta} = R(A - 3Bt^2)\hat{\theta}$$

Part c:
$$\overrightarrow{a} = R\alpha\hat{\theta} - R\omega^2\hat{r}$$
$$\overrightarrow{a} = R(-6Bt)\hat{\theta} - R(A - 3Bt^2)\hat{r}$$

Part d:<br>
Centripetal acceleration: $\overrightarrow{a_r} = -R{(A - 3Bt^2)}^2\hat{r}$<br>
when $A = 3Bt^2$,
$$\overrightarrow{a_r} = 0$$
$$t = \sqrt{\frac{A}{3B}}$$
