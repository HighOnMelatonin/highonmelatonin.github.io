## Week 1-1: Climate Change
Climate: Summarising over years <br>
Weather: Short term <br>

Greenhouse effect refers to the process where the atmosphere traps the sun's heat, thus increasing the temperature of the planet.
Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapour)

GWP: Global Warming Potential, a measure of the estimated contribution to global warming a gas has when it is directly emitted into the atmosphere.

### Effects of Global Climate Change on ocean
#### Thermohaline Circulation - ocean currents
- Salty water freezes, salts do not fit in the crystal structure of ice and is expelled
- Surrounding saltwater gets saltier and denser
- Denser saltwater sinks
- Less dense saltwater rises
- Currents; responsible for 90% of the water movement in ocean

Worldwide current system
- Cold water from north and south
- Warmer water from equator
- Cold water sinks and is displaced by warmer water

Thermohaline circulation affects both the weather and climate of the global system 

#### Concentration of CO2 with Temperature
Ocean Carbon Cycle

As water temperture increases, the ability to dissolve $CO_2$ decreases

#### Net Zero
net zero means that the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced out by their removal

### Overview of 3 levels of biodiversity
1. Ecosystem Diversity
   - Diversity of a habitat in a given unit area
2. Species diversity
   - Diversity among species in ecosystem
3. Genetic Diversity
   - Diversity of genes within a species

Species diversity has 2 components, richness and evenness: <br>
Species richness: Total number of different species<br>
Species evenness: relative abundance of each species<br>

Diversity Index: A tool to compare the biodiversity between two or more sampling areas using a simple number.

#### Shannon Index (H) (Entropy fraction)
Taking into account of both the richness and evenness of the species in the community <br>
Shannon Index(H) 
$$-\sum^S_{i=1} p_i \ln{p_i}$$
S: the number of species in a community <br>
p: Proportion of individuals of i-th species in a community <br>
p = $\frac{n}{N}$ <br>
n: individuals of a species <br>
N: total number of species <br>



### Biodiversity Loss
1. Habitat loss
   - Single greatest threat to biodiversity
   - Habitat fragmentation
2. Pollution
   - Air pollution
   - Noise and light pollution
   - Water pollution
3. Over harvesting
   - Harvesting a renewable resource to the poiint of diminishing returns
   - Overfishing
   - Poaching
4. Invasive species
5. Climate Change

### Urban Heat Island Effect
City experiences much warmer temp than nearby rural areas
- Rural areas are covered with dense plants in which transpiration acts as heat regulation
- 

### UN Sustainable Development Goals

## Week 2-1: Atoms
An atom is an electrically neutral, spherical entity composed of a positively
charged central nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons

Atomic number: Z
Mass number: A

### Organisation of electrons
Valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost principal shell, outermost shell
is the one with the highest principal quantum number, n. Valence electrons are 
important for chemical bonding

<table>
<tr>
   <th>Shell</th><th>Subshell</th><th>Max electrons in subshell</th>
   <th>Max electrons in shell</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>1</td><td> 1s</td><td>2</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>2</td><td>2s</td><td>2</td><td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td></td><td>2p</td><td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>

Notation convention:
$$1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3s^2$$

$1s$: 1st shell <br>
$1s^2$: 1st shell with 2 electrons <br>
$2p^6$: 2nd shell (subshell p) with 6 electrons <br>

### Periodic Trends
#### Shielding Effect
Presence of inner electrons act as a barrier between the outer electrons and the 
nucleus.
- Outer electrons experience a reduced effective nuclear charge
- Inner electrons exert a repulsive force on outer electrons, creating an 
expansionary effect

#### Effective nuclear charge
Nuclear charge (Z): Generated by positive proton charge <br>
Shielding Effect: Generated by negative ellectron repulsion <br>
Effective nuclear charge ($Z_{eff}$): Overall net effect <br>
$$Z_{eff} = Z - \text{shielding effect}$$

Across the period:
- Nuclear charge increases
- electron added to the same shell
- Increase in shielding << increase in nuclear charge

Down the group:
- Nuclear charge increases
- Electron added to the outer shell
- Increase in shielding >> increase in nuclear charge

#### Trends in atomic radii
Across the period:
- Increase $Z_{\text{eff}}$
- Outer shell experience greater attraction inwards, radius decreases

Down the group:
- Decrease $Z_{\text{eff}}$
- Outer electrons experience decreased attraction, radius increases

<strong>Ions and Ionic radius<br></strong>
Cation: Positive charge <br>
Anion: Negative charge <br>
Effective nuclear charge dictates atomic radius

<strong>Isoelectronic</strong> <br>
Refers to different atoms

#### Ionisation energy
Ionization energy is the minimum energy needed to remove the outermost electron

The energy needed to remove electrons increases with each successive removal

More energy is needed to remove negatively charged electrons froma positively 
charged ion.

Trends:<br>
Across the period:<br>
- Increase in effective nuclear charge
- Outer electrons experience increase attractive force from nucleus
- More energy required to remove first electron

Down the group: <br>
- Decrease in effective nuclear charge
- Outer electrons added to bigger shell and experience decreased attractive force from nucleus
- Less energy required to remove electron

#### Trends in electron affinity (EA)
Electron affinity is the energy change accompanying the addition of 1 mol of 
electrons to 1 mol of gaseous atoms or ions

Across the period:
- Increase in effective nuclear charge
- Added electron experience increased attractive force from nucleus
- More negative energy
- EA increases in magnitude

Down the group:
- Decrease in effective nuclear charge
- Added electrons experience decreased attractive force
- Less negative energy
- EA decreases in magnitude

#### Trends for electronegativity
Electronegativity is the relative ability of a bonded atom to attract shared electrons
- generally elements with high EN also has a highly negative EA
generally, EN increases across period and decreases down the group



### Questions:
Q: Why doesn't the atom collapse on itself, if electrons are attracted to the nucleus? <br>
A: In the classical mechanics model, the atom should collapse, but from observation,
the atom does not, therefore, we dismissed classical mechanics on this scale and 
created quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics states that there are discrete energy 
levels, known as quanta, which means the electron cannot gradually move towards the 
nucleus, and must exist at a certain, discrete energy level. The precise location of
the electrons are probabilistic.
