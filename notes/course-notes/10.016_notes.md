## Week 1-1: Climate Change
Climate: Summarising over years <br>
Weather: Short term <br>

Greenhouse effect refers to the process where the atmosphere traps the sun's heat, thus increasing the temperature of the planet.
Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapour)

GWP: Global Warming Potential, a measure of the estimated contribution to global warming a gas has when it is directly emitted into the atmosphere.

### Effects of Global Climate Change on ocean
#### Thermohaline Circulation - ocean currents
- Salty water freezes, salts do not fit in the crystal structure of ice and is expelled
- Surrounding saltwater gets saltier and denser
- Denser saltwater sinks
- Less dense saltwater rises
- Currents; responsible for 90% of the water movement in ocean

Worldwide current system
- Cold water from north and south
- Warmer water from equator
- Cold water sinks and is displaced by warmer water

Thermohaline circulation affects both the weather and climate of the global system 

#### Concentration of CO2 with Temperature
Ocean Carbon Cycle

As water temperture increases, the ability to dissolve $CO_2$ decreases

#### Net Zero
net zero means that the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere are balanced out by their removal

### Overview of 3 levels of biodiversity
1. Ecosystem Diversity
   - Diversity of a habitat in a given unit area
2. Species diversity
   - Diversity among species in ecosystem
3. Genetic Diversity
   - Diversity of genes within a species

Species diversity has 2 components, richness and evenness: <br>
Species richness: Total number of different species<br>
Species evenness: relative abundance of each species<br>

Diversity Index: A tool to compare the biodiversity between two or more sampling areas using a simple number.

#### Shannon Index (H) (Entropy fraction)
Taking into account of both the richness and evenness of the species in the community <br>
Shannon Index(H) 
$$-\sum^S_{i=1} p_i \ln{p_i}$$
S: the number of species in a community <br>
p: Proportion of individuals of i-th species in a community <br>
p = $\frac{n}{N}$ <br>
n: individuals of a species <br>
N: total number of species <br>



### Biodiversity Loss
1. Habitat loss
   - Single greatest threat to biodiversity
   - Habitat fragmentation
2. Pollution
   - Air pollution
   - Noise and light pollution
   - Water pollution
3. Over harvesting
   - Harvesting a renewable resource to the poiint of diminishing returns
   - Overfishing
   - Poaching
4. Invasive species
5. Climate Change

### Urban Heat Island Effect
City experiences much warmer temp than nearby rural areas
- Rural areas are covered with dense plants in which transpiration acts as heat regulation
- 

### UN Sustainable Development Goals
