## Course Overview

## Week 1-1: Electrical Charge
### Point Charge
Electron can be considered a point charge
- Not a point from quantum POV, but gives a good approximation

### Coulomb's Law
$$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^2} \hat{r_{12}}$$
$$=$$
$$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^3} \overrightarrow{r_{12}}$$
$r_{12}$: Vector pointing from 1 to 2 <br>
$F_{12}$: Force on point charge $q_2$ due to point charge $q_1$<br>
$k_e$: Coulomb constant, 8.9875

### Principle of Superposition
For more than 2 charges, the net force on any one charge is the vector sum of the forces

## Week 1-2: Electric Field
Electric field $\overrightarrow{E}$:
$$\overrightarrow{F_0} = \sum_{i = 1}^N k_e \frac{q_i q_0}{r_i^2} \hat{r_i} = q_0 \overrightarrow{E}$$

$$\overrightarrow{E}{_\text{point charge}} = \frac{k_e q_s}{r_{sp}^2} \hat{r_{sp}}$$

s: source <br>
p: point of interest

Electric field lines:
1. Direction vector is tangent to the field lines at any point
2. Field lines originate from positive charges and end at negative charges
3. Denser lines = greater magnitude
4. No field lines can cross
5. Field lines only show direction of acceleration

### Electric Dipole
- Two equal but opposite charges $+q$ and $-q$, separated by a distance d
- Dipole moment two charges is defined as, $\overrightarrow{P} \equiv qd \hat j$
- $\overrightarrow{P}$ points from negative to positive charge
- $\overrightarrow{P}$ is different from electric field
- Dipole moment for neutral charge distribution of N point charges:
$$\sum_{i = 1}^N q_i = 0 \rightarrow \overrightarrow{p} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \overrightarrow{r_i}$$

<strong>STUDY CASE PROBLEM 2.1</strong> <br>
To find the charge separation of O-H bond in a water molecule is to find the charge at one H atom, te charge at another H tom, and the charge at O atom.

### Force and Torque on Electric Dipole
$$\tau = \overrightarrow{p} \times \overrightarrow{E}$$

$$\overrightarrow{E} = E \hat{i}$$
$$\overrightarrow{r} = 2a (\cos \theta \hat i + \sin \theta \hat j)$$
$$\overrightarrow{p} \equiv \overrightarrow{r} q = 2qa (\cos \theta \hat i + \sin \theta \hat j)$$
$$\tau = \overrightarrow{r} \times \overrightarrow{F_+}$$
$$\tau = PE\sin\theta$$

## Week 2-1: Electric field and Continuous charge distribution
Electric field by a sizeable body (not point charge) <br>
When we have a rigid body with continuous charge distributions, we cannot treat it as
a point charge anymore. The nearby electric field of the charged body is not a point
charge $\overrightarrow{E}$ field anymore.

$$Q = \lim_{N \rightarrow \inf} \sum^N_{i = 1} \Delta q_i$$
$$Q = \int_{\text{body}} dq$$

$$d\overrightarrow{E} = k_e \frac{dq}{r_{sp}^3} \overrightarrow{r_{sp}}$$
$$\overrightarrow{E} = \int d\overrightarrow{E}$$

### Charge Density
Charge Density: $\lambda \equiv \frac{dq}{dl}$, surface charge density, $\sigma \equiv \frac{dq}{dA}$; volume charge density, $\rho \equiv \frac{dq}{dV}$ <br>
Charge densities are not uniform if the volume is not uniform

$$\overrightarrow{E} = \int k_e \frac{dq}{|\overrightarrow{r}_p - \overrightarrow{r}_s|^3} (\overrightarrow{r_p} - \overrightarrow{r_s})$$
Solving equations:
1. Write dq in terms of geometrical patterns (dl, dA, dV) using charge density
   1. Write in terms of the coordinate system set up
   2. It should be geometrical variable as dq varies with position
2. Find $\overrightarrow{r_p}$ and $\overrightarrow{r_s}$
3. Calculate $\overrightarrow{r_p} - \overrightarrow{r_s}$ and sub into the equation
4. Perform integration


### Approximation Technique (for s >> L)

The electric field around the center of the rod, $E_{center} = \frac{k_e Q}{s} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{L}{2})^2 + s^2}}$



From a far distance, this L, looks like a point charge

The main concept of approximation is $\frac{L}{S} << 1$, and this $(\frac{L}{S})^2$
would be even smaller that can be eliminated in approximation

rewrite the term $\frac{1}{}$previous formula $\approx \frac{1}{s}$

$$\overrightarrow{E}_{\text{center}} = \frac{k_e q}{s} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{L}{2})^2 + s^2}} \approx \frac{k_e Q}{s^2} \hat{r}$$

### Approximaiton Technique (for s << L)
Consider an infinite long rod, or s << L, $\frac{s}{L} << 1$ and any $(\frac{s}{L})^2$

rewrite $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{L}{2})^2 + s^2}} \approx \frac{1}{s}$ 


## Week 2-2: Gauss's Law
### Electric Flux
Electric flux, $\Phi_E$ is a measure of the number of electric field lines passing through an area. 
- The larger the area, the more field lines go through it, thus more flux
- The stronger the electric field, the greater the flux (denser field lines)
- Electric flux is a scalar quantity
- Electric flux does not involve the flow rate (time)

Electric field through a flat surface:
$$\Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$$

Non uniform $\vec{E}$ and curved surface:
$$\Phi_E = \int \int d\phi_i = \int \int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$$

Types of surfaces:
1. Closed surface
   - Contains volume
   - Can be made up from many open surfaces
   - The direction of the normal vector always points from inside out
2. Open surface
   - Is defined by a closed path boundary
   - Does not contain volume
   - Can freely define the area vector $\hat{n}$

Electric Field through a Closed surface:
$$\Phi_E = \oiint d\Phi_E = \oiint \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$$

Spherical Coordinates:
r: Radial distance from the origin to the point <br>
$\hat{r}$: Direction of r <br>
$\theta$: Angle between r and z axis <br>
$\hat{\theta}$: Tangent to the point in the plane of $\theta$ <br>
$\phi$: Angle between r and x axis <br?
$\hat{\phi}$: Tanget to the point in the plane of $\phi$ <br>

$$d\vec{A} = Rd\theta R \sin \theta \text{ } d\phi \hat{r}$$
$$d\vec{A} = R^2 \sin \theta \text{ } d\theta d\phi \hat{r}$$

### Gauss's Law
Electric flux $\Phi_E$ for an enclosed surface is proportional to the charge $Q_{\text{enclosed}}$ <strong>inside</strong> the volume of the closed surface

$$\Phi_E = \oiint_{\text{closed surface s}} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\epsilon_0}$$
