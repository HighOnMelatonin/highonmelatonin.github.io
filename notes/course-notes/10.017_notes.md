## Week 1-1: Electrical Charge
### Point Charge
Electron can be considered a point charge
- Not a point from quantum POV, but gives a good approximation

### Coulomb's Law
$$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^2} \hat{r_{12}}$$
$$=$$
$$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^3} \overrightarrow{r_{12}}$$
$r_{12}$: Vector pointing from 1 to 2 <br>
$F_{12}$: Force on point charge $q_2$ due to point charge $q_1$<br>
$k_e$: Coulomb constant, 8.9875

### Principle of Superposition
For more than 2 charges, the net force on any one charge is the vector sum of the forces
