## Course Overview

## Week 1-1: Electrical Charge
### Point Charge
Electron can be considered a point charge
- Not a point from quantum POV, but gives a good approximation

### Coulomb's Law
$$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^2} \hat{r_{12}}$$
$$=$$
$$\overrightarrow{F_{12}} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}^3} \overrightarrow{r_{12}}$$
$r_{12}$: Vector pointing from 1 to 2 <br>
$F_{12}$: Force on point charge $q_2$ due to point charge $q_1$<br>
$k_e$: Coulomb constant, 8.9875

### Principle of Superposition
For more than 2 charges, the net force on any one charge is the vector sum of the forces

## Week 1-2: Electric Field
Electric field $\overrightarrow{E}$:
$$\overrightarrow{F_0} = \sum_{i = 1}^N k_e \frac{q_i q_0}{r_i^2} \hat{r_i} = q_0 \overrightarrow{E}$$

$$\overrightarrow{E}{_\text{point charge}} = \frac{k_e q_s}{r_{sp}^2} \hat{r_{sp}}$$

s: source <br>
p: point of interest

Electric field lines:
1. Direction vector is tangent to the field lines at any point
2. Field lines originate from positive charges and end at negative charges
3. Denser lines = greater magnitude
4. No field lines can cross
5. Field lines only show direction of acceleration

### Electric Dipole
- Two equal but opposite charges $+q$ and $-q$, separated by a distance d
- Dipole moment two charges is defined as, $\overrightarrow{P} \equiv qd \hat j$
- $\overrightarrow{P}$ points from negative to positive charge
- $\overrightarrow{P}$ is different from electric field
- Dipole moment for neutral charge distribution of N point charges:
$$\sum_{i = 1}^N q_i = 0 \rightarrow \overrightarrow{p} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \overrightarrow{r_i}$$

<strong>STUDY CASE PROBLEM 2.1</strong> <br>
To find the charge separation of O-H bond in a water molecule is to find the charge at one H atom, te charge at another H tom, and the charge at O atom.

### Force and Torque on Electric Dipole
$$\tau = \overrightarrow{p} \times \overrightarrow{E}$$

$$\overrightarrow{E} = E \hat{i}$$
$$\overrightarrow{r} = 2a (\cos \theta \hat i + \sin \theta \hat j)$$
$$\overrightarrow{p} \equiv \overrightarrow{r} q = 2qa (\cos \theta \hat i + \sin \theta \hat j)$$
$$\tau = \overrightarrow{r} \times \overrightarrow{F_+}$$
$$\tau = PE\sin\theta$$
