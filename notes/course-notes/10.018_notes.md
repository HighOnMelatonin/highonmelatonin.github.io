## Week 1-1: Vectors and Multivariable functions
### Multivariable functions
A function of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers in a set D a unique real number denoted by f(x, y). The set D is the domain of f and its range is the set of values that f takes on

### Linear Combination
<strong>Important for linear algebra</strong><br>
A vector $\vec{v}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $\vec{v_1}$, $\vec{v_2}$, . . . ,
$\vec{v_k}$ if it can be expressed as:
$$\vec{v} = \alpha_1 \vec{v_1} + \alpha_2 \vec{v_2} + . . . + \alpha_n \vec{v_n}$$
for some scalars $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, . . . , $\alpha_n$ 

## Week 1-2: Level curves and Partial Differentiation
The level curves of a 2 variable function f(x, y) are the curves with equation f(x, y) = k where k is a constant. The Kth- level curve of f is the curve defined by the equation f(x, y) = k.

A collection of level curves of a function f(x, y) is called a contour map of f.

### Partial Derivatives
Partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to x
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x,y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta x}$$

Partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to y
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lim_{\Delta y \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta y} = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x,y + \Delta y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta y}$$

To find $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, treat $y$ as a constant, then take the derivative with respect to $x$. <br>
To find $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ treat $x$ as a constant, then take the derivative with respect to $y$. <br>

### Symmetry of second derivatives
If $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ are continuous at a point, then they are equal at that point

## Week 2-1: Tangent Plane Approximation
The equation of the tangent plane to a surface $z = f(x, y)$ at a point $P = (x_0, x+0, f(x_0, y_0))$ is given by:
$$z = f(x_0, y_0) + f_x(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)$$
It is common to denote $f(x_0, y_0)$ by $z_0$, so this equation can also be written as
$$z - z_0 = f_x(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)$$

General form of the equation of a plane:
$$Ax + By + Cz = D$$
Where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are variables.

### Directional Derivatives
Consider $Q = (x_0 + hu_1, y_0 + hu_2)$, where $h > 0$, whose displacement from P is
$h\vec{u}$ Since $||\vec{u}|| = 1$, the distance from P to Q is $h$. thus,
$$\text{Average rate of change in f from P to Q} = \frac{f(x_0 + hu_1, y_0 + hu_2)}{h}$$

To find instantaneuous rate of change, we let $h \rightarrow 0$:
$$D_{\vec{u}}f(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0 + hu_1, y_0 + hu_2)}{h}$$

$$D_{\vec{u}}f(x_0, y_0) = f_x(x_0, y_0)u_1 + f_y(x_0, y_0)u_2$$
Sometimes $D_{\vec{u}}f(x_0, y_0)$ is written as $f_{\vec{u}}(x_0, y_0)$ <br>
Unit vector u, must be a unit vector (length 1)

### The Gradient Vector
$$D_{\vec{u}}f(a, b) = f_x(a, b) \vec{u_1} + f_y(a, b) \vec{u_2} = \nabla f(a,b) \cdot \vec{u}$$
$$
\nabla f(x, y)
= \begin{vmatrix}
  f_x(x, y) \\
  f_y(x,y)
\end{vmatrix}
= f_x(x, y) \vec{e_1} + f_y(x, y) \vec{e_2}
$$

Properties of gradient vector:
- Gradient vector is always normal to the level curve
- In the direction of the maximum rate of increase of f
- Magnitude of vector is the max rate of change of f at that point
- large when contours are close and small when far apart

## Week 2-2: Chain Rule, Implicit Diff, Critical Points
### Chain Rule
Chain Rule for multivariable functions:
$$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt}$$

$$\frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \frac{dz}{dt}$$

Chain rule where x and y are differentiable functions, $x = g(u, v)$ $y = h(u,v)$
$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{ \partial u} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}$$
$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{ \partial v} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}$$

### Local Extrema
1-Var: $f'(x) = 0$ <br>
2-Var: $f_x(x_0, y_0) = 0 \text{ and } f_y(x_0, y_0) = 0$ <br>
