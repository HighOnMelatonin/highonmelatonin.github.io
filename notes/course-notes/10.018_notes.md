## Week 1-1: Vectors and Multivariable functions
### Multivariable functions
A function of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers in a set D a unique real number denoted by f(x, y). The set D is the domain of f and its range is the set of values that f takes on

### Linear Combination
<strong>Important for linear algebra</strong><br>
A vector $\overrightarrow{v}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $\overrightarrow{v_1}$, $\overrightarrow{v_2}$, . . . ,
$\overrightarrow{v_k}$ if it can be expressed as:
$$\overrightarrow{v} = \alpha_1 \overrightarrow{v_1} + \alpha_2 \overrightarrow{v_2} + . . . + \alpha_n \overrightarrow{v_n}$$
for some scalars $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, . . . , $\alpha_n$ 

## Week 1-2: Level curves and Partial Differentiation
The level curves of a 2 variable function f(x, y) are the curves with equation f(x, y) = k where k is a constant. The Kth- level curve of f is the curve defined by the equation f(x, y) = k.

A collection of level curves of a function f(x, y) is called a contour map of f.

### Partial Derivatives
Partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to x
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{\Delta x \rArr0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \rArr 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x,y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta x}$$

Partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to y
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lim_{\Delta y \rArr0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta y} = \lim_{\Delta x \rArr 0} \frac{f(x,y + \Delta y) - f(x, y)}{\Delta y}$$

To find $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, treat $y$ as a constant, then take the derivative with respect to $x$. <br>
To find $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ treat $x$ as a constant, then take the derivative with respect to $y$. <br>

### Symmetry of second derivatives
If $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ are continuous at a point, then they are equal at that point
